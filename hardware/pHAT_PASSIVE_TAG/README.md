# RFM69HCW-868-S2 Partial HAT for pi Zero
This project includes KiCAD 5.0 CAD files to make a pi Zero HAT with connections from SPI0 device 0 to an RFM69HCW-868-S2 868 MHz transceiver. It was inspired by the OpenAPS project: https://github.com/openaps/openaps.

This board makes connections from the table on https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/Gear%20Up/edison.html#hardware-information-for-pi-based-setups-with-rfm69hcw-experimental 

| Board | Connect | Connect | Connect | Connect | Connect | Connect | Connect | Connect |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| RPi | 3.3V | GND | MOSI | MISO | SCLK | | CEO_N | |
